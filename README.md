- Preferably use let or const instead of var.
- You could make an IIFE, for example at main.js line 708-721
- Great job with commenting you own code. Very useful with the sometimes long files.
- Really nice graphics, very joyful to play.
- It is a heavy game to play, sometimes did not work well with live link.
- Try and break out more code into smaller files if possible, for example at main.js line 70-122
- Great naming with the variables and functions, easy to understand.
- Good folder structure.
- Use a [.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to avoid trouble with indentation and merge conflicts.
- There is a lot of repetitive code for creating all the objects for example pathwayModels.js. Maybe if would be easier to use classes instead of repeating the same code.

## Art & Sounds

We take no credit for the models and sound
